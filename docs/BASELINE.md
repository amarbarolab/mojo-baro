# Baseline — what is verified working

Current truth for `mojo-baro`. Every number here was measured on this machine and
is reproducible with the command given. If you are an agent picking up a kernel
task, this is your starting point: **do not re-derive it, and do not trust a
number that is not in this file or produced by `bench/run.py`.**

## Hardware and toolchain

| | |
|---|---|
| GPU | AMD RX 7900 XTX, **gfx1100 (RDNA3)** — 24 GB, ~22.3 GB free to MAX |
| Warp size | **32** (RDNA3, *not* 64 like CDNA) |
| LDS | 64 KB/block |
| ROCm | 7.2, hipBLASLt present at `/opt/rocm/lib/libhipblaslt.so` |
| Mojo | **1.0.0** — repo-local venv, `./.venv/bin/mojo` |
| MAX | 26.5.0 |
| Rust | 1.97.1 (service layer not started) |

Nothing is installed machine-wide. `uv` created `.venv` from the Modular nightly index.

## Layers

```
Python/app  →  Mojo (GPU kernels)  →  C++ shim (vendor SDK)  →  hipBLASLt
                      ↑
                    Rust (network/API shell) — NOT STARTED
```

Rust talks only to Mojo's C-ABI surface. It must **not** bind the C++ shim
directly: two independent owners of one hipBLASLt context is a lifetime bug.

## What runs

| Component | Path | Verify with |
|---|---|---|
| C++ hipBLASLt shim | `shim/` | `./run-tests.sh` |
| Mojo FFI binding | `kernels/baro.mojo` | `./run-tests.sh` |
| GEMM kernels | `kernels/matmul.mojo` | `./bench/run.py` |
| Bench + correctness engine | `bench/run.py` | `./bench/run.py` |
| Parameter sweep | `bench/sweep.py` | `./bench/sweep.py` |

`./run-tests.sh` builds the shim and checks an fp16 GEMM through the C ABI
against a host reference. `./bench/run.py` gates on correctness *before*
reporting throughput and exits non-zero if any variant is wrong.

## Measured kernel performance

512×512×512, fp32, 200 iterations, 10 warmup. Run-to-run spread <0.5%.

| variant | GFLOP/s | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `hipblaslt` | ~2490 | **vendor baseline**, fp32, via the C++ shim |
| `matmul_naive` | ~1180 | one thread per output element |
| `matmul_tiled` | ~2270 | 16×16 shared-memory tiles |
| `matmul_regtile` | **~5170** | BM32 BN32 BK8 TM2 TN2, swept |

Scaling, regtile vs hipBLASLt: **2.1× at 512³, 2.4× at 1024³, 2.0× at 2048³.**
regtile sustains ~7.1 TFLOPS at 1024³ and 2048³, roughly **23% of the ~30.7
TFLOPS plain-FMA peak** (~61 TFLOPS is the dual-issue figure).

**Read the fp32 win carefully.** hipBLASLt is tuned first for fp16/bf16 and for
CDNA; fp32 on RDNA3 is not its strong path. Beating it here does *not* mean we
are at vendor-optimal for AI workloads. The honest comparison is fp16/bf16
against matrix cores (WMMA), which we have not written yet and would very
likely lose today.

## Hard-won facts — do not relearn these

**Mojo 1.0 API.** `fn`, `alias`, `let`, `inout`, `owned` are all gone; use `def`,
`comptime`, `var`, `mut`. Imports take a `std.` prefix.

**`DLHandle` no longer exists.** FFI goes through `external_call`, and the binary
must be linked against the shared library at build time:
`-Xlinker -L<dir> -Xlinker -lbaro_shim -Xlinker -rpath -Xlinker <dir>`.
`mojo run`'s JIT will **not** resolve external symbols and `LD_PRELOAD` does not
reach it — build AOT.

**`Pointer` is non-null by design** and cannot hold a C handle that may come back
null. Carry opaque handles as `Int`, or use `Optional[Pointer[...]]`.

**Kernel scalar arguments must be fixed-width.** `Int`/`UInt` are not
`DevicePassable` — use `Int32` and convert inside the kernel.

**Accumulators must be SIMD values with comptime-unrolled indices.** Holding them
in `stack_allocation` gives you *scratch memory*, which on AMD lives in device
memory. The first register-tiled kernel did this and ran at 570 GFLOP/s —
**slower than naive**. Same algorithm, 6.4× apart.

**Benchmark at ≥200 iterations.** At 20, launch overhead dominated: both variants
reported roughly half their true throughput with ~10% run-to-run spread.

**CMake: link `hip::host`, not `hip::device`,** for a shim with no device code.
`hip::device` injects `--offload-arch` flags a non-clang host compiler rejects.

**t-strings reject format specifiers** — build JSON with String concatenation.

**Cache hipBLASLt workspace and algorithm on the context.** Running the
heuristic and a `hipMalloc`/`hipFree` per call costs more than the GEMM at these
sizes: it benchmarked the vendor library at 1373 GFLOP/s, *below our naive
kernel*, and would have overstated our result by 1.8×. A vendor baseline that
looks bad is a bug in your harness until proven otherwise.

**MAX `DeviceBuffer.unsafe_ptr()`** yields a raw device address that the shim's
hipBLASLt calls accept directly — no copy needed to compare against vendor.

## Tuning findings

Small tiles win on RDNA3, contradicting NVIDIA-derived tiling guidance. Every
top-5 swept configuration uses BM=32 or 64; hand-picked BM128/BN128/TM8/TN8
**regressed to 1651 GFLOP/s** (0.45×), almost certainly register pressure
collapsing occupancy. Occupancy is buying more than data reuse here.

Do not trust large-tile intuition on this card. Measure it.

## Rules for kernel work

1. **Correctness first.** A fast wrong kernel is a failure. `bench/run.py`
   checks before it times.
2. **One number, one commit.** Results are logged to `bench/log.jsonl` tagged
   with the commit that produced them.
3. **Numeric parameter search belongs in `bench/sweep.py`,** not in a human or
   an agent. It is exact, free, and already beat a hand-tuned config by 1.38×.
4. **New strategies go in their own file** (`kernels/matmul_<strategy>.mojo`) and
   register a variant in `bench/bench.mojo`. Never edit another agent's kernel.
