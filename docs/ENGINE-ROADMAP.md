# Engine roadmap — what llama.cpp has that we don't

Written 2026-09-01, after `amar_matmul_skinny` beat tuned hipBLASLt 1.49x at the
decode shape (`46693f9`). Conclusion of that work: the GEMM layer is ahead of
everything around it. A faster matmul changes nothing until a forward pass
exists to put it in. This file is the gap inventory and the build order.

Target model: Qwythos-9B (embedding 4096, ffn 12288). fp32 weights are
~36 GB and do not fit in 24 GB — **fp16 is a prerequisite, not an
optimization**. The WMMA kernels already exist; the skinny kernel needs an
fp16 variant (halves B traffic, doubles its roof).

## Gap inventory vs llama.cpp

**The "nothing" column below is the 2026-09-01 state and is now historical.**
Current state is in the right-hand column, updated 2026-09-16.

| Layer | llama.cpp | mojo-baro 2026-09-01 | mojo-baro today |
|---|---|---|---|
| Weight loading | GGUF mmap + every quant format | nothing | GGUF v3 parser + `engine-pack.py` (bf16/q8/q4-draft); q8 pack bit-equal to `llama-quantize` Q8_0 |
| Tokenizer | own BPE/SPM impl | nothing | `serve/tokenizer.mojo`, bit-equal to llama.cpp on the same GGUF, default path since 2026-09-08 (`docs/TOKENIZER.md`) |
| Elementwise kernels | RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, softmax | nothing | all present in `kernels/elementwise.mojo`, <=1e-6 vs fp64 host refs |
| Attention | flash-decode style, GQA | nothing | GQA decode path + hybrid SSM sub-block (`attn.mojo`, `ssm.mojo`) |
| KV cache | paged, quantized cache | nothing | paged cache (128-token pages, block table, identity per request since A2 step 1 `09a8cd9`) sized by `BARO_TMAX` with split-K decode attention above T = 1088 (lane-dattn `3824e20`) + (k+1)-slot ring for MTP rollback; not paged, not quantized |
| Forward pass | graph per arch family | nothing | six architectures: `qwen35` dense (token-identical to llama.cpp 64/64), `qwen35moe` 256-expert MoE, and `spark2_5` plus `llama`, `qwen2`, `granite` on the profile-driven dense engine (`serve/spark.mojo`, recipe read from the GGUF by `tools/gen-profile.mojo`; now wired to the HTTP front too, `serve/PROTOCOL.md`, verified end to end for Qwen2.5-7B and granite-4.2-3b) |
| Sampling | full menu | nothing | device sampler in the `serve/engine.mojo` decode loop at `temperature > 0` (top_p, top_k, min_p, seed), composed with MTP speculation (`bench/spec-sample-protocol.md`); also in `serve/spark.mojo` for all five dense-path models and verified on qwen35moe (`exchange/lane-SAMPLE-report.md`); penalties and logprobs parsed, not acted on |
| Server | OpenAI-compatible HTTP | empty `serve/src` | `baro-serve` (Rust, axum/tokio): chat + completions with SSE, models, cancel, fork, tokenize, detokenize, health; `tools` and `chat_template_kwargs` in chat; `response_format` refused with 400 until the grammar mask is in the decode loop (`serve/PROTOCOL.md`) |
| Prefill | batched, causal-mask | n/a | batched and chunked, WMMA flash attention + one-wave SSM scan; within ~1.3x of llama.cpp at 8k to 32k (`docs/prefill-long-ctx-2026-09-11.md`) |
| GEMM decode M=8 | ~roofline via quants | **1.49x over vendor fp32** | q8 wave-per-row `amar_matmul_skinny_q8row`, 855 GB/s |
| Decode tok/s | 74.1 no-spec / 123.5 MTP (20-prompt, q8) | 25.5 | q8: 68.8 no-spec / 100.7 MTP. **q4, the current champion: 136.37 no-spec / 150.96 with spec** (20-prompt medians). qwen35moe: 111.89 no-spec against llama.cpp 109.92 (`bench/moe-persist-protocol.md`) |

Note the fp32/fp16 framing in the section above is several quantisations out of
date. The engine went q8-only at `c3752e7`, and the default pack is **q4**
today (`BARO_PACK`, default `.work/engine-pack-q4`). fp16 was never the
endpoint.

## Build order — each milestone has a hard verify

Principle: shortest path to a token-level parity check, then speed. Parity
before performance at every step (see BASELINE's retracted-claim lesson).

1. **fp16 skinny + safetensors loader.** Load real Qwythos-9B weights
   (safetensors via mmap; GGUF can wait — HF is the reference anyway).
   Verify: one real weight matrix through skinny-fp16 matches fp32 host ref.
2. **Elementwise kernel pack.** RMSNorm, RoPE, SwiGLU, softmax, embedding
   lookup, argmax. All bandwidth-trivial at M=8; correctness is the work.
   Verify: each vs a NumPy reference on real shapes.
3. **Single transformer layer, contiguous KV cache.** Attention as
   skinny-GEMM + fused softmax first; flash-decode later.
   Verify: layer-0 output parity vs HF transformers on the same inputs.
4. **Full greedy decode.** Tokenizer via HF `tokenizers` through the Python
   layer (writing our own BPE is llama.cpp-envy, not value).
   Verify: N greedy tokens identical to HF reference. **This is the "we
   have an engine" line.**
5. **tokens/sec vs llama.cpp on this box, same weights.** Only scoreboard
   that counts. Expect to lose first round; profile, fix the top kernel.
6. **Quant decode (int8 → int4) dequant-in-kernel**, fused SwiGLU/bias
   epilogues, paged KV, sampling menu, Rust HTTP shell. Order by what the
   step-5 profile says, not by what is fun.

## Non-goals for now

- Multi-GPU, batching/scheduling (vLLM's turf — single-request decode first).
- Own tokenizer, GGUF writer, CPU inference path.
- Beating llama.cpp on formats; we beat it on this GPU or not at all.

## Amendment 2026-09-01 — milestones 1–2 done; milestone 3 rescoped

Done and verified this session:
1. **GGUF loader path + bf16 GEMM** — `tools/gguf-extract.py` (full v3
   parser incl. metadata values), `matmul_skinny_wt` consumes GGUF-native
   [out, in] weights, `test_gguf_gemm` passes on real blk.0.ffn_up.weight
   (max rel err 6e-4 vs numpy fp32).
2. **Elementwise pack** — amar_rmsnorm/amar_swiglu/rope/softmax/embed/argmax in
   `kernels/elementwise.mojo`, all ≤1e-6 rel err vs fp64 host refs.

Rescope: metadata shows qwen35 is a **hybrid SSM/attention** arch —
`ssm.conv_kernel=4, state_size=128, group_count=16, inner_size=4096`,
`full_attention_interval=4` (3 of 4 layers are linear-attention/SSM),
GQA 16 q / 4 kv heads at head_dim 256, YaRN rope (factor 4, sections
[11,11,10,0], freq_base 1e7), MTP block 32. Milestone 3 therefore needs
TWO layer types (SSM/linear-attention + gated full attention), not one —
llama.cpp's qwen3.5 implementation is the working reference. Reference
against llama.cpp layer dumps, since no HF transformers class may match
this checkpoint locally.
