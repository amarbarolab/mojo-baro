# fp16 WMMA GEMM: closing the gap to aiter

Bound by `PROTOCOL-RULES.md`. Predictions frozen 2026-09-01 at commit d44dea8
(working tree), BEFORE any kernel change. Baseline: `kernels/matmul_wmma_lds.mojo`
as of that commit, measured by `bench/bench_fp16.mojo` at 512/2048/4096 cubed
(`.work/fp16-sizes.sh base`).

## Diagnosis (from reading the kernel, not from measurement)

1. The 72-config sweep behind `WARPS 4x4 WTILE 2x1` ran at 512^3 only:
   64 blocks of 64x64 on 96 CUs, card never full. Config is a latency optimum
   applied at sizes where aiter leads 3.3x.
2. Global->LDS staging is 2-byte scalar loads with a per-element bounds branch,
   16 per thread per K-step.
3. WTILE 2x1: 3 fragment loads per 2 mma. LDS-bandwidth bound.
4. No double buffering: two barriers per 16 elements of K, global latency exposed.

## Steps and frozen predictions (GFLOP/s ratio vs baseline, same size)

| step | change | 2048^3 | 4096^3 | verdict rule |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 16-byte vector global loads for A and B staging, scalar fallback on edge tiles | >= 1.3x | >= 1.3x | < 1.1x = diagnosis 2 wrong, stop and re-diagnose |
| 2 | re-sweep WARPS/WTILE at 4096^3 (not 512^3) | >= 1.3x on top of 1 | >= 1.5x on top of 1 | best config within 5% of current = diagnosis 1 wrong |
| 3 | register-prefetch double buffering, BLK_K 32 | >= 1.2x on top of 2 | >= 1.2x on top of 2 | |

Each step: correctness gate must pass at all three sizes; 512^3 may regress
up to 10% (it is the latency regime). Any arm's receipt = the `blk`, `warps`,
`wtile`, `grid`, `block` fields the bench now prints, plus m/n/k.
