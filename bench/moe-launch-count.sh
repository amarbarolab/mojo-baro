#
# Per-token kernel launch count for the MoE decode path, from rocprofv3's own
# kernel trace rather than from counting enqueue_function call sites by eye.
# R4's prediction (bench/moe-persist-protocol.md) is stated in LAUNCHES
# (1216 -> about 1116), so the tok/s A/B alone cannot confirm or refute it:
# this is the receipt that can.
#
# The count is dispatches during the decode phase only. Load, prefill and the
# one-off allocation memsets are excluded by counting the trace for two runs
# that differ only in generated length and taking the difference, which cancels
# everything that does not scale with tokens. That is also why this needs no
# knowledge of which kernel names belong to which phase.
